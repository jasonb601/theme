<h2><font color="#CC3333"> Danny Millan, Singer and Frontman for A.D.Q. (The Danny Millan Trio), Goes Solo</font></h2>

</center>

<p class="ex"> After his A+ performance with his band, A.D.Q., at Severna Park High School's Battle of the Bands, Danny was very displeased with his faliure to win the battle. Soon after the battle, he became angry with his bandmates and his fans. He started getting into fights which became more physical each time, causing him to serve some time in some hospitals and jail cells. Having enough time to think, he decided it was a good idea to go solo, and thus releasing his new single "Laura."</p>

<h2><font color="#9900CC">Advisory Blog - Friday the 13th</font></h2>

</center>

<p class="ex">  In advisory, we have talked about many different things. The dress which some see as blue and black or white and gold. I don't understand why everyone has to fight. I  mean I see blue and gold and like nobody sees that like me. I just wish they would stop making fun of me. I want it to stop before I jump off that ledge my friend. Another thing we talked about is gay marriage. We really got into depth about what their mothers were feeling knowing that their son was a homosexual.</p>

The band made their debut performance at Severna Park High School's Battle of the Bands. Unfortunately they did not win, but they were a close sixth. Just before their school's spring break, they released their debut album with Hopeless Record, Quiet Skunk. The album features hit songs like Empty Houses, Bulletproof Slime, Miss Saggy, and Emo Clown Jungles. Following the release of their album, they began a week tour over spring break. The band tried to play at Severna Park High Schoool's S.T.A.R. Week, but failed to get in due to administration issues. The band is was desperately trying to find shows after loosing their manager, Michelle Hickman. On Wednesday, April 15th, 2015, the band recruited Quinton's father as their new manager. He immediatly was on the phone with many contacts and managed to get the band a spot at Coachella 2016, opening up for their former member who is now at large, Danny Millan. The band also is said to appear in scenes of upcoming films such as Something Worth Remembering 2: The Sister Sequel, Heist pt II, Frogman, The Movie, and Fast and Furious 14.
